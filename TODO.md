# To Do List

* Complete the core linear algebra features comparison
* Complete the comparison of domain specific functionality (Geometry, FFT, Random, Statistics)
* Develop a test suite for cross-checking results across implementations
* Enhance the usability of the comparison by linking mathematical features to wikipedia articles
* Perform a high level performance comparison
* Update library API comparisons to latest versions:
    * eigen 3.3.X
    * armadillo 10.4.X
    * numpy 1.20.X
